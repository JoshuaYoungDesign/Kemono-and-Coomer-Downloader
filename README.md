The **Kemono and Coomer Downloader** is a tool that allows you to download posts from the [Kemono](https://kemono.su/) and [Coomer](https://coomer.su/) websites.

With this tool, you can download single posts, multiple posts sequentially, download all posts from a profile, and download all DMs from a Kemono profile. You can also configure what you want to save in the posts: attachments, videos, create a `.txt` file with information about the post, among others.

### Download Post

To download specific posts, just enter the post link. If you want to download multiple posts, separate the links with a comma. Example:

```sh
https://kemono.su/patreon/user/133054/post/82477856 , https://coomer.su/fansly/user/285310079517863936/post/614339200069672960 , https://coomer.su/fansly/user/285310079517863936/post/611301068940255234
```

### Download All Posts from a Profile

Enter the link of a Kemono or Coomer profile, and the script will start downloading all posts that match the program configuration for downloading all posts from a profile.

### Download DMs

This only works for profiles on the Kemono website, as Coomer does not have this feature. Just put the profile link, and all DMs will be extracted in `.txt` format and saved in the `dm` folder.

## File Organization

Posts are saved in folders for easier organization. The folder structure is as follows:

1. **Platform:** A main folder is created for the platform (Kemono or Coomer).
2. **Author:** Inside the platform folder, a folder is created for each author.
3. **Posts:** Inside the author's folder, there is a `posts` folder where posts are saved. Each post is saved in a subfolder identified by the post ID.
4. **DMs:** Inside the author's folder, there is also a `DMs` folder where the `.txt` DM files are saved.

Example of the folder structure:

```
